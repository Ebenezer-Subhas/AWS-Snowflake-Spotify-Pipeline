# AWS-Snowflake-Spotify-Pipeline
In this project, I have built an ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Spotify API on AWS and Snowflake. The pipeline will retrieve data from Spotify API, transform it to a desired format, and load it into loaded into Snowflake Database using its Serverless feature called Snowpipe.
